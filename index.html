       What is E-Waste?
       </h1>
        <p>
          Electronics that are no longer used are mostly keep away inside until it plies up in the storage of one's home to be either sold or thrown away to the trash bin. One thing that many holders do is to check if the electronics they no longer use could be recycled or even as thought of it. We continue to inovate and create new electronics that are better than the ones we use, while continue to incrase the amount of electronics being disposed of.

        Why is E-Waste so important?
      </h1>
      <p>
        E-Waste is a huge problem that is affecting the environment and the people who live in it. E-Waste is a huge problem because it is not only the electronics that are thrown away, but also the people who live in it. The people who live in it are the ones who are most affected by it, and the electronics that are thrown away are the ones that are most affected by it.

       The electronics that build up in landfills can soon produce toxins that can pose a serious risk to the environment to the soil, water, air, and wildlife. As it dissolves in microscopic traces in the burried landfill, the toxin pools below the surface.

            We want to let others know the impact of electornic waste on the environment. We want to help the environment and the people who live in it as well as ourselves. We generate an estimated amount of 50 million tons each year according to WHO, but only less than 20% of that is recycled. The goal is to hopefully improve recycling rate up to a minimum of 25% up to 35% by 2030. Join us in our effort to help the environment and the people who live in it.
