       What is E-Waste?
       </h1>
        <p>
          Electronics that are no longer used are mostly keep away inside until it plies up in the storage of one's home to be either sold or thrown away to the trash bin. One thing that many holders do is to check if the electronics they no longer use could be recycled or even as thought of it. We continue to inovate and create new electronics that are better than the ones we use, while continue to incrase the amount of electronics being disposed of.

        Why is E-Waste awereness is so important?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Electroncs have been innovating very fast as each day passes by to the point where most of them are soon to be disposed of. It is one of the fastest growing waste in the world, increasing faster than our population. We create an average of 40 million tons of electronics per year, which is concerning. Only 15% or less of e-waste get recycled, while the rest is sent to landfils and incinerators are mostly burned, releasing harmful toxins in the air. The electroincs although is not filing our landfills, but the majority of it are transported to other countries either Asia or Africa.

       The exsposure of e-waste contains different types of toxins that gets relesed when not propetly dispsoing or recycling. As the continues to be released to the envirnment, it conaminates the air, solid, and water in neighbouring communities and wildlife.

    <p> The practice of recycling electronics is a very important thing to do. It is a way to reduce the amount of waste. The video is a great way to learn more about the process of recycling electronics, inncluding ensuring  the data that hard drives carry. </p>

            We want to let others know the impact of electornic waste on the environment. We want to help the environment and the people who live in it as well as ourselves. We generate an estimated amount of 50 million tons each year according to WHO, but only less than 20% of that is recycled. The goal is to hopefully improve recycling rate up to a minimum of 25% up to 35% by 2030. Join us in our effort to help the environment and the people who live in it.
